## About

This proyect is an e-commerce website. Its build with react js and material UI.
Images are hosted in Digital Ocean spaces. 
The api conneceted to this client its builded in node js with express.
Many forms and configuration are based in the client requiremnts, thats why some things are weird to understan ( it was more difficult understand the client D: )
The website is finished and functional.

In te future i expect to implement new features.

At the moment there is no available host to this website, only localhost.
